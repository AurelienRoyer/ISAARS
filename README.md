# SEAHORS
Spatial Exploration of ArcHaeological Objects in R Shiny


SEAHORS is a R Shiny free open-source application, that allows easy and quick exploration of the spatial distribution of archaeological objects.
The main goal of this application is to make the two and three-dimensional spatial exploration of archaeological data as user-friendly as possible, 
in order to give opportunities to researchers not familiar with GIS and R to undertake such approaches. <br>
SEAHORS has an easily accessible interface and uses text and Excel files (.csv and .xls respectively). The application  includes functions to merge several databases, 
for example when spatial data and analysis data are stored in separate files. <br>
SEAHORS can generate five types of plots: 3D, 2D and density plots, as well as plots for which it is possible to cut off the site into slices and to modify the angle 
of projection to explore spatial organisation without constraint of the grid orientation. SEAHORS has visualization tools with several sorting and formatting keys 
(colours) applicable to coordinates and all possible analysis variables (i.e. levels, splits, analytical attributes).


## Demonstration and tutorial
Demonstration instances of the application are deployed on the Huma Num Shiny server:
